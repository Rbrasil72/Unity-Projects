# Endless Void
My first finished project.
It's a endless runner style game with the main character being a ghost trying to reach the end of the void for eternal life in heaven. 
Was my final project for school, one of my favourite projects so far where i learned alot.


# Monochrome
My second project.
A few months after finishing school and on my first job when i had free-time, started to make a simple platformer with the art style being pixel and minimalistic with 3 or 4 colors total.
Very early concept with basic platformer movement with running, jumping and a very interactive main menu screen.
